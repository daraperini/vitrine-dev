# The Store

The Store is a fictional e-comerce created by me as an exercise.

## Detalhes do projeto

You can navagate the website as you wish: change the display through the display button and see the products as a list or as grid, sort the products using filters or searche for a specific product using the search box.
And if you did not finish your purchase but you have to close the tab, that's ok! Your shopping cart is going to be there once you open the page again - through the use of the local storage.
